# GAN-Generated-Synthetic-Malignant-Samples-for-Breast-Cancer-Detection

<small>
The inherent class imbalance in breast cancer di-
agnostic datasets limits the generalizability and accuracy of
ML models, often resulting in the under-detection of malignant
instances. In this study, a minority class augmentation approach
for tabular clinical data − through a Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) trained exclusively on malignant samples − to
generate high-fidelity synthetic minority instances while avoiding
noise from majority class features. The augmented data are
then used to balance the training set for a soft-voting ensemble
classifier. Using 5-fold stratified cross-validation, the proposed
model achieved an average validation accuracy of 98.07% and
F1-score of 97.40%, with low standard deviations indicating
robustness. Comparative analysis against recent augmentation
frameworks shows competitive or superior results, supporting
the effectiveness of targeted GAN-based augmentation for robust
breast cancer classification.
